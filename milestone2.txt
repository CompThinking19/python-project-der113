It's so impressive how much you've gotten this working! I was able to play through the entire game in my terminal and you even managed to use a "try...except" pattern, which is not something I taught in class. Great, great work here. The thing I'd have you focus on now is not necessarily code, but the "so what factor": why am I playing through a quiz game about amusement rides? What do you want the player to leave with? You understand this implicitly, but make it explicit for your player. Also: you probably don't want to ask every single stat in your dictionary, although i'm really pleased you managed to figure out how to abstract the question asking and keep your code DRY: that's major points on the final project.
