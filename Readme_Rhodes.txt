Python Project - Amusement Ride Accidents
Due 11/26/19

I wanted to do a project on amusement ride accidents because every time my kids go on rides, I wonder how safe they really are. We tend to joke as parents about the rides looking rusty, sounding like they're falling apart, and looking unsafe. We usually just assume they are and put our children on in blind faith that the rides are inspected and any accident is a freak occurrence. After the girl died who was ejected from my daughter's favorite ride in Deerfield, I wondered if there were any statistics on it. I found a site called Saferparksdata.org. They collect data from two places - industry regulatory reports and hospital data provided by the NEISS. The data set includes information from 2007-2017. The Saferparks 2017 data set has approximately 8,000 amusement ride accident reports from 28 state agencies and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. If parents are aware of how many accidents there really are, perhaps they will be more inclined to follow ride safety rules and also to force amusement companies to do the same. For example, some children don't meet the height requirement, but parents convince the operator to let them on a ride that isn't safe for their height, which can result in a serious injury. I've witnessed this personally at every carnival we've ever attended.

Pulling the data I needed from the file and putting it in dictionaries was a bit challenging. Had I not had help, I don't know that I would have it working the way I wanted. Googling my issues was not helpful because the information I found wasn't as complicated as my data set and what I wanted from it. Another challenge I faced was getting the correct answer to match the value in the dictionary. Because I tested for int in the user input, I wanted to add a 'q' option to quit. When adding int or the quit option only one would work not both. I finally figured out I needed to switch my if and elif statement to get both to work.

My program pulls columns from the data set into two dictionaries, which I later combined, filtering the data set injuries by state and by ride type. I had to create separate dictionaries to get injuries per ride type and injuries by state, then combined into one to pull the data for my guessing game from one source. I imported random to randomly pull the key/values into a general question, to keep my program DRY, which I could then plug in the state or ride type. I made a decision not to have multiple choice because I felt it was more of an impact on the user to have a guess that could be far off from the actual answer. I have an intro that displays what my game is, its purpose, and how to play. It asks if they want to play, then displays a question to the user to input their number guess if they do. If not, it displays a message and refers them to the safer parks website. If answers are correct, it displays correct. If wrong, it displays the right answer. In both cases I created a list to keep a count of right/wrong answers to show the user at the end of the game (or when they quit). I've included the website saferparks.org for them to learn more about ride safety tips at the end of the game. I used import, for loops, if/elif/else statements, print statements, lists, dictionaries, user input, while statements, comparisons, and exception handling.
